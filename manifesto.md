## Design Manifesto

### Overview
During this course, I had hands-on experience designing, implementing, and testing multiple prototypes that were meant to accomplish different things. I worked with multiple groups of different people and, as a result, experienced several varying perspectives on how to approach the design process. Over the course of the term I was able to develop and improve my own design method. The design process that I have found to be the best begins by identifying the primary goal that I hope to accomplish with my design. The next step consists of brainstorming and taking note of any ideas followed by developing a prototype that implements these ideas. The final two steps are user testing and analyzing feedback from the users to form ideas on how to refine the prototype.
