## Design Manifesto

### Overview
During this course, I had hands-on experience designing, implementing, and testing multiple prototypes that were meant to accomplish different things. I worked with multiple groups of different people and, as a result, experienced several varying perspectives on how to approach the design process. Over the course of the term I was able to develop and improve my own design method. The design process that I have found to be the best begins by identifying the primary goal that I hope to accomplish with my design. The next step consists of brainstorming and taking note of any ideas followed by developing a prototype that implements these ideas. The final two steps are user testing and analyzing feedback from the users to form ideas on how to refine the prototype.

### Step 1: Identifying Goals
Each project given to us had a different focus. The first step in the design process was to identify a goal that adheres to the focus of the project. This step involves determining exactly what a the application being designed should do. For example, for the [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@masteidel/design-for-k-12-teachers-46644bf5bd6d) project, each group had to redesign a website for a specific group of people. The purpose of this project was for each team to identify goals that were aimed to help a specific group.

### Step 2: Ideation
If step one of the design process is meant to determine the "what," then step two is meant to determine the "how." In this step we would brainstorm ideas and write and sketch down any we deemed to be viable. Nowhere was this more apparent than the [Design for Understanding](https://medium.com/@hr23232323/prevalence-of-diseases-in-the-united-states-over-the-past-90-years-f62d14d40089) project. During this project we were tasked with presenting information in two different ways. For both of these we spent a long time devising potential approaches to each method of presentation. We sketched down initial ideas and then fleshed them out.

### Step 3: Implementation
The next obvious step is to begin implementing the ideas formulated in the last step. This step involves actually building the prototype to be tested and seeing what works and what doesn't. Many design elements are changed or refined during this step. It is at this point that we can see if our initial designs can be feasibly implemented in an understandable way.

### Step 4: Testing
After completing the prototype, it needs to be tested by users with no prior experience with it. In this step, we can see exactly how the user goes about interacting with the application. We can see if the users' behavior meets our expectations or if the acted surprisingly. We then get the users' opinions and suggestions for the prototype.

### Step 5: Analysis
The final step of the design process is the analysis of users' interaction with the prototype and their feedback. After having multiple people test our prototype and witnessing how they used the application and having them tell us their thoughts, we go through this information and draw conclusions from it. We try to see what our prototype's strong points were and where it needs improvements. We use this information to determine how we could improve the current project as well as make future projects better than previous ones.
